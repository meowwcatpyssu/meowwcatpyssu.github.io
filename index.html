<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Finding one's way in machine learning and deep learning. </em></strong></h2>
<p>About 4 years ago, while reflecting on a topic, what I should dedicate my current reincarnation to, I came up with what seems simple and straightforward idea <strong><em>Add some knowledge and profit for humankind and push transhumanism. </em></strong>While the goal doesn't sound S.M.A.R.T (specific, measurable, &hellip;), its main purpose was to define at least some ultimate criteria for me to decide -what activities I'd rather engage and spend my limited lifetime on, and which doesn't worth it.</p>
<p>After 4 years of studying and working in area which marketers call A.I., managers - machine (or deep) learning and engineers do by sklearn/pytorch/keras I'm slowly coming to conclusion the initial goal is no so easy achievable in the area partially due to reasons far beyond technical limitations.</p>
<p>One of examples - during the start of my journey I was excited I'll be able to work on technologies like a self-driving car, and really improve the people lives around the world by saving millions hours, they spend on driving and some lives. Looking now at the development of the topic - I can observe - while 4-5 years ago was quite clear, that main metric of safety of such a vehicles should be number of causalities by 10^8 or 10^9 miles and once they will outperform humans at this dimension they have to be widely adopted and this will allow saving thousands of lives per year [1].<br />However, nowadays if you look at public discourse - no one even tries to measure it, but once accident happens - mainstream news are flooded with the vivid description of how terrible the accident was and how irresponsible to let technology go ahead, without any attempt to refer to above metric. While trying to gather any single source of information for such a statistics is extremely hard, and one have to look for it much further than first several pages of search engine. To get some estimate I had to combine information from various sources, like [2] and [3] and no one trying to reflect on that numbers in public discussions anymore (by the way, data suggests technology is safer than human drivers and can therefor save lives).</p>
<p>What are points of public discourse now, expect trying to persuade people that autonomous cars are dangerous by colorfully depicting accidents - are</p>

  <li>&ldquo;mass loses of jobs&rdquo;, where jobs are considered to be worthful of its one sake, even if doing this jobs have negative impact on society as a whole. There are deep sociological roots of such an issue, but I'd better address you to David Graeber &ldquo;Bullshit jobs&rdquo; , who is doing much better than me in describing phenomena.</li>
  <li>not ready insurance and legislation frameworks to deal with self-driving cars, which seems taken out of political agenda thanks to the &ldquo;job loss potential&rdquo; of the technology.</li>
